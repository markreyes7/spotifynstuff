Using Spotify API music will be added to personal database and different for spotify will be created to enhance my spotify experience
MOTIVATION: 
I am in the process of building this project for the reaosn that I currently find myself sometimes bothered by the spotify playlists that are offered. Some problems that occur are:
  1. Liking songs make them appear WAY TOO much in spotify automated playlists.
  2. Songs in some playlists often do not belong in certain playlists. (Ex. Nipsey Hussle and Tame Impala should not be in Daily Mix #1)
  3. Songs appear to frequently.
With those issues in mind there are some goals I have in mind with this project.

GOALS:
Some of the goals that I intend to achieve in this projecta are:
  1. Automate playlist creation based of the songs in my database only.
  2. Find new music.
  3. Understand and work with personal data to make predicitions and forecast music listening behavior.


WHY IS THIS DIFFERENT?
This project will allow me to get as personal as possible with the music of my taste. I believe that I will be able to see behaviors in my music listening taste and truly enhance my overall spotify experience.
